My GitHub account was just made. It will allow me to upload my code to the internet and be able to change it without breaking anything.
The repository I created only has this read me file in it for now.
I downloaded the github desktop version, logged in, and was asked if I had a repository that I wanted to add, I selected download from web and put the one I just made on my computer.
